Description: Find out a card using a sentence made up by another player
  A player (who we will call the author) creates a new game. 
  He chooses a card, picks a word or a sentence to describe it
  and invites players to participate.
  Each players is given seven cards and are required to pick
  one that best matches the author's sentence.
  Once enough players have chosen a card, the author displays all chosen
  cards and the players try to figure out which one is the author's.
  The author wins if at least one of the players guesses right, but not all
  of them do. The winners are the author and the players who guessed right. 
  If the author loses, all the other players win.
