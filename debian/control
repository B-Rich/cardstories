Description: multiplayer online card guessing game
 This package provides a server for a networked guessing game using
 picture cards. One player (the "author") creates the game by choosing
 a card, picking a word or a sentence to describe it, and sending out
 invitations to others to participate.
 .
 Each of these players receives seven cards and has to pick
 one that best matches the author's description.
 .
 Once enough players have chosen a card, the author displays all chosen
 cards and the players try to figure out which one is the author's.
 .
 If at least one but not all of them guesses correctly, the author
 wins, along with the players who guessed correctly. Otherwise, the
 guessers all win.
