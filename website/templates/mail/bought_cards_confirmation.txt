We have received your payment of 4.50 EUR for 10 extra cards.

Thank you for your purchase! You get a whole new set of possibilities for your next games, and you also help Card Stories by financing future developments.


# How does it work?

The extra 10 cards have been added to your deck, you should start seeing them during your next games.

They will appear randomly when you create a new game or when you originally chose a card in someone else's game - just like any card you can get in the game when you level up.


# Any questions?

Just reply to this email or write to feedback@farsides.com, we'll be glad to answer you!

Thanks again : )
